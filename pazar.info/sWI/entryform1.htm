      <p class="title3">Some hints:</p>
<p>- You can use this interface to enter data to an already existing project or to a new one. Writing here a new project name will add this project to your project list (see <a href=http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/editprojects.pl>My Projects</a>), your user password will be used as a project password and this project will be listed as 'restricted'. If you'd rather use another password and/or want to be in control of your project creation, please go to <a href=http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/editprojects.pl>My Projects</a> page to create your project first.</p>
<p>- TF centric submissions are based on a specific Transcription Factor from which you want to annotate binding sites.<br>CRE centric submissions are annotations of a Cis Regulatory Element (CRE) from which you have experimental evidence of a role in gene regulation (binding or other).</p>
